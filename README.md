# Paper-Trading platform for CLI

## Description

The objective of this program is to be a fast, versatile and robust platform to paper-trade trading stratgies. 

It helps traders like me, to quickly test our strategies using live data without losing any money.

## the layout of the files are as follows:

* functions.py: contains the libraries and the functions.
* paper_trade.py: is synonymous with main.py
* paper_trading_working.ipynb : is the jupyter notebook, where i test the functions before implementing them in the main program.
* portfolio.pkl: is the portfolio df, stored to keep records of your trading behavior.

### Future:

1. Additional Features
	* Implement futures and options trading system
	* Implement technical indicators
	* Implement limit order functionality.

2. Possibly implement this program in c, to reduce the running time.
